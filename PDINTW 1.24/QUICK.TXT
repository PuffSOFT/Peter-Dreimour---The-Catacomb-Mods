^C^1TO ALL USERS WITH SVGA GRAPHICS ADAPTERS
^C^1****************************************

If your computer has an SVGA graphics card, you may see some unwanted 
graphics effects when you begin to play the actual game.
There is nothing to worry about if that happens. 

To correct any problems with the graphics display of this game, type the 
following to begin play:

^C^1START /COMP

This should clear up any graphics display problems you might see on your 
SVGA system!


^C^I*              Important MEMORY REQUIREMENTS to play               *

THE CATACOMB 3-D ADVENTURE games are "graphics intensive" by design,
meaning that you are in for a true visual feast once you begin play.  To
accomplish this great feat, the program will need to use most of your
computer's 640K of conventional memory. In fact, the program requires at
least 590K free to run properly. You should have no problem playing, BUT,
if the game ever announces that you need more "free memory" to continue, do 
the following:

Rename the files named AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS on your boot disk to
AUTOEXEC.XXX and CONFIG.XXX respectively.  For example, from DOS you would 
type:  RENAME AUTOEXEC.BAT AUTOEXEC.XXX [ENTER]

Reboot your computer.

Change to the game directory (e.g. CD \ABYSS), and type START [ENTER] to 
restart. When you've finished playing, rename AUTOEXEC.XXX and CONFIG.XXX
back to their original names, and reboot your computer. Sorry for any 
inconvenience.  Enjoy this great game!
